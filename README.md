# Data-Structures
Data structures which I implemented in C++ for my assignments.


Note that some of the files includes strutils.h and strutils.cpp so that I put them.
Some of the classes are templated so that you should exclude their .cpp files from building.

It is also important to state that these implementations are not fully generic.
They are modified for my own assignments.
